      <description>Secrets are for sensitive information that needs to be shared between environments and people working on a project. For example, you can securely store API keys and database passwords using secrets. Secrets are client-side encrypted values, meaning that they are not stored on our servers and ActiveState cannot access your secret values.
To add a secret to your project:
 In Your Dashboard, select the organization that contains the project you want to add a secret to and then click the Projects tab, or click the Projects tab in your dashboard to add a secret to a personal project.</description>

      <description>The following sections describe the tasks you need to complete to set up a CI/CD process with Travis CI, your version control system (VCS), and the ActiveState Platform. You need the appropriate access to these systems to complete the setup. In the examples below, we show configuration steps for GitHub specifically. You may need to adjust some of the tasks if you are using a different VCS.
Travis currently provides only limited support for Windows builds, and Windows configuration won&amp;rsquo;t be covered in this guide.</description>

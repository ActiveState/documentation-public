      <description>The State Tool offers a number of methods for simplifying and securing your Project configuration and integrating it with your development environment.
For information on installing the State Tool, see the installation section.
Creating Your First Project The State Tool cannot do anything without a project, everything lives under your project.
You can create your project either via the State Tool itself via the state init command or by going directly to the ActiveState Platform Dashboard and creating it there.</description>

      <guid>https://activestate.github.io/documentation-public/contributions/devug/add-ingredient/</guid>
      <description>Chapter 1: Adding your first ingredient In order to add a new ingredient, it&amp;rsquo;s easiest to use the state tool to create a template ingredient file which you can add detail to. We&amp;rsquo;ll create an ingredient for a python module called mypymodule which we&amp;rsquo;ll suppose is ready for release. Run
state ingredient new mypymodule --version 0.0.1 --namespace language/python This will create a mypymodule directory under your current working directory with a single template file mypymodule.</description>

      <description>Chapter 2: Adding dependencies When writing our mypymodule python module, we decided to use some other open source modules to help out, specifically we decided to use the popular numpy and scipy modules. We need to tell the platform that these modules are required by anyone who wants to use mypymodule. If we have been preparing our module for installation with pip and have a requirements.txt, a pipfile or a pyproject.</description>

This is a sample blank ingredient with an example of a possible extended toochain descriptor. Note it has an executor toolchain which should be present on the build image and whose definition should contain the mechanism for running this kind of build.</description>

      <description>Secrets are for sensitive information that needs to be shared between environments and people working on a project. For example, you can securely store API keys and database passwords using secrets. Secrets are client-side encrypted values, meaning that they are not stored on our servers and ActiveState cannot access your secret values.
To add a secret to your project:
 In Your Dashboard, select the organization that contains the project you want to add a secret to and then click the Projects tab, or click the Projects tab in your dashboard to add a secret to a personal project.</description>

      <description>The following sections describe the tasks you need to complete to set up a CI/CD process with Jenkins, your version control system (VCS), and the ActiveState Platform. You need the appropriate access to these systems to complete the setup. In the examples below, we show configuration steps for GitHub specifically. You may need to adjust some of the tasks if you are using a different VCS.

      <description>The following sections describe the tasks you need to complete to set up a CI/CD process with Travis CI, your version control system (VCS), and the ActiveState Platform. You need the appropriate access to these systems to complete the setup. In the examples below, we show configuration steps for GitHub specifically. You may need to adjust some of the tasks if you are using a different VCS.
Travis currently provides only limited support for Windows builds, and Windows configuration won&amp;rsquo;t be covered in this guide.</description>

      <guid>https://activestate.github.io/documentation-public/contributions/devug/03-versions/</guid>
      <description>In previous examples we showed you how to add simple ingredients to the BuildGraph without any kind of lineage. Every edit we posted was a Revision to the single Ingredient. The revision you are given when asking for Artifacts depends entirely on the time stamp given. Software authors however often ship source for multiple versions of the same software. The BuildGraph models this as well and gives you powerful tools to choose the most appropriate version for your requirments.</description>

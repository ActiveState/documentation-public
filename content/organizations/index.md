## Creating Organizations

Organizations allow you to group your projects and the users permitted access to those projects. Every project belongs to an organization, and each organization is separate. An organization has one or more members. You can create, or be invited to, more than one organization. For example, you could create an organization for your personal work or side project, and also be invited to join your company's organization.

To create an organization:

1. Click menu at the top right of the page that displays your username, and select **Account Settings**.
2. Click **Organizations**.
3. Click **Create a New Organization**.
4. In **Organization Name**, enter the name to display in the ActiveState Platform.
5. Accept the suggested **URL** based on your Organization Name, or specify a shorter, easier to remember URL.
6. Click **Create Organization**.
    
    When you create an organization, you are automatically assigned ownership of the Organization, which allows you to invite and manage users for the Organization.

7. The next step after creating a new Organization is to invite users. For more information, see [Sending invites](#sending-invites).

## Sending Invites

You can invite other users to join your organization. Each user you invite will receive an email with a unique link that allows them to accept your invitation and access the data associated with your organization. If they are not already users of the ActiveState Platform they will need to create an account.

Invited users are listed in the Pending Invites list until they accept the invite to the organization. You can resend the email, if necessary, by clicking the **Resend** link.

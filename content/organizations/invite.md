title: Sending Invites
---

You can invite other users to join your organization. Each user you invite will receive an email with a unique link that allows them to accept your invitation and access the data associated with your organization. If they are not already users of the ActiveState Platform they will need to create an account.

Invited users are listed in the Pending Invites list until they accept the invite to the organization. You can resend the email, if necessary, by clicking the **Resend** link.

There are several distinct types of projects you can create or access on the ActiveState Platform:

- **Public Projects**: Custom projects or forked projects created by users and available to other Platform users.
- **Private Projects**: Custom projects or forked projects created by users that are restricted to the organization they are created in. Private projects are only available to organizations on paid tiers.
- **Featured Projects**: ActiveState's Community Edition languages used by millions of developers to kickstart their development. See the [Featured Projects & Languages](https://platform.activestate.com/featured-projects) page on the ActiveState Platform.
- **Managed Projects**: ActiveState distributions that are specifically created, updated, and tested for an organization by ActiveState. Managed projects are private.

### Custom projects

You can also create your own custom projects that just contain what you need for your development projects. You can chooses the specific packages, language(s), and operating system(s) to include. For more information, see [Creating custom projects](/projects/custom).

## Forking projects

You can fork any project you have created in your personal account, or in any organizations you belong to. For example, you can create a custom project in your personal account and build and test it, and then fork it to an organization you belong to so your entire team has access to the exact same build.

If you belong to an organization on the Business tier or Enterprise tier you  can also fork ActiveState managed projects available to that organization. These projects include builds created and tested by ActiveState. Any fork you create from these projects tracks the original project and gets updated packages and bug fixes automatically when ActiveState updates the managed project. These are private projects that you cannot customize. For more information, see [Forking projects](/projects/forks).

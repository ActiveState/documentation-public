## Introduction

GraphQL is _a query language for your API_. It provides a declarative method for the client to define the nested data it needs. The client can specify the data to expand or rename in their request.

GraphQL gives you better control over the data transferred from the server because you can specify that exact fields and objects you want.

"GraphiQL is an in-browser IDE for exploring GraphQL schemas where you can test queries and easily view the data being returned from the server." 

"With GraphiQL, youâ€™re provided with schema definitions from your GraphQL server and can explore what options are available without relying on your developers to make the API super descriptive." vs. REST APIs where the developer is more dependant reading documentation to understand its uses and limitations

Some features of GraphiQL are:

- Automatic query completion
- Syntax highlighting
- Inline suggestions for appropriate fields, arguments, types, etc.
- Syncronization with the current GraphQL schema
- Self documenting schema

# Extended toolchain descriptor for an ingredient

## Composable toolchains

**Note:** This document describes how an ingredient would describe the toolchain(s) required to build it, not how we would define a toolchain within the platform

This is a sample blank ingredient with an example of a possible extended toochain descriptor.  Note it has an `executor` toolchain which should be present on the build image and whose definition should contain the mechanism for running this kind of build.  It also has multiple `adjunct` toolchains which only need to be present on the build image.  Together with any platform restrictions listed here and the platform restrictions which come in via the order, these form a set of constraints for the build image.

All toolchain definitions should declare multiple platform variants, the variant to be chosen by the solver based on order constraints (e.g. `devtoolset-6` on `CentOS7` with cpu `x86_64` would resolve to a unique concrete instance of a toolchain)

We may want to allow multiple toolchains of the same type to be present in the same image (e.g. `devtoolset-6` and `devtoolset-7`) where this is possible.  In this case, the toolchain definitions should contain mechanisms for selecting themselves for the build (e.g. set `PATH`, use debian `alternatives`, run `vcvars.bat`)

The extended descriptor below has features to supply options to a toolchain in both generic (e.g. `env` vars) and toolchain-specific (e.g. `conf_args`) sections.  The sections applicable to a toolchain should be composed from a generic set and any defined by the toolchain itself.  It also supplies a mechanism (dubbed `translations` below) in which a toolchain descriptor may flesh out (or override) how certain build flags are expressed.  In this example, we state that a request for a debug build should be expressed as a new `configure` argument (`--enable-symbols`) and that a thread-enabled build should be expressed as both a `configure` argument (`--enable-threads`) and an additional environment variable (`LIBS=-lpthread`)

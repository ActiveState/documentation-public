1. GraphQL & ActiveState Platform
 - "GraphQL allows you to declaratively express your data needs...queries are the representation of the data you need."
 - "Notice how the query signature exactly matches the returned JSON signature. This is possible because in GraphQL, you query against a schema that is the representation of your available data."
 - "GraphiQL is a UI that lets you 1) run queries against your data in the browser, and 2) dig into the structure of data available to you through a data type explorer.""

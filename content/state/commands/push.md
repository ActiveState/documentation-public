title: "Command: push"
---

The `push` command enables you to push your local changes to the ActiveState Platform. For example, you can use the `init` command to create a new project locally using the State Tool, and then push this change to the Platform so it shows up in your account, and is accessible in the Dashboard.

## Usage

```text
state push
```

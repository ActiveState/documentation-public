title: "AppVeyor"
---

The following sections describe the tasks you need to complete to set up a CI/CD process with AppVeyor, your version control system (VCS), and the ActiveState Platform. You need the appropriate access to these systems to complete the setup. In the examples below, we show configuration steps for GitHub specifically. You may need to adjust some of the tasks if you are using a different VCS. 

## Gathering environment variable settings

**Before you begin**: 

* You need an ActiveState Platform account. If you do not currently have an account you can sign up for free at: [https://platform.activestate.com/create-account](https://platform.activestate.com/create-account). 
* You need to have the State Tool installed on your computer, and authorized with the Platform using the `state auth` command, in order to run the command to retrieve the API key, and to access your `private.key` file if you are using secrets.

The State Tool will use the following environment variables if they are defined:

* **ACTIVESTATE_API_KEY**: This API key is used to authenticate the State Tool with the ActiveState Platform, as required, to download language projects, update packages, etc. If you use ActiveState Platform secrets in your build process or scripts run by the build process, you must also configure the ACTIVESTATE_PRIVATE_KEY.
* **ACTIVESTATE_PRIVATE_KEY**: Optional. The private key to use for decrypting secrets.

### Obtaining your API Key

Currently, you can only generate an API Key by calling our API directly using a `curl` command. Open your command prompt, and copy and paste or enter the following command: 

```text
curl -X POST "https://platform.activestate.com/api/v1/apikeys" \
-H "accept: application/json" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer `state export jwt`" \
-d "{ \"name\": \"APIKeyForCI\"}"
```

Example response:

```text
{
  "name": "APIKeyForCI",
  "token": "MjZlMGI5YzQtYzFkMS00MmUxLTllYjAtODRjMjA5YzVjZTNmXlFhQ3llUW9WeGlzaTUxNzku",
  "tokenID": "26e0b9c4-c1d1-42e1-9eb0-84c209c5ce3f"
}
```

In this example, you would copy the token value to use as the ACTIVESTATE_API_KEY environment variable in your CI/CD application: `MjZlMGI5YzQtYzFkMS00MmUxLTllYjAtODRjMjA5YzVjZTNmXlFhQ3llUW9WeGlzaTUxNzku`

### Obtaining your Private Key

You can find the private key value at `<configdir>/activestate/cli-unstable/private.key`.

The configdir varies per platform, but in most cases will be at one of:

* Windows: `%HOME%\AppData\Roaming\activestate\cli-unstable\`
* Linux: `~/config/activestate/cli-unstable/`
* macOS: `~/Library/Application\ Support/activestate/cli-unstable/`

The private key environment variable expects the contents of the `private.key` file, not the filepath.

## AppVeyor setup

1. Log in to Appveyor CI at http://appveyor.com.
2. Click **New Project**.
3. Click **Update Installations**
4. On the **Install AppVeyor** page, select the organization your code repository belongs to, and follow the steps on screen to authenticate with GitHub and configure the selected repository integration with AppVeyor.<br><br>![]({{< relref "appveyor-permissions.png" >}})
5. Click **Add** next to the new repository entry in AppVeyor.
6. Click the **Settings** tab on the project page.Ã¥
7. Click **Environment**.
8. Click **Add variable**
9. Enter the name and value for each API key you want to use and click the lock icon to encrypt the value. For information on the required values, see [Obtaining your API key](#obtaining-your-api-key) and, if applicable, [Obtaining your private key](#obtaining-your-private-key).
    **IMPORTANT**: The ACTIVESTATE_API_KEY is used to authenticate the State Tool automatically whenever required by the CI/CD build steps.<br><br>

## ActiveState Platform project setup

You can use either the Dashboard or the State Tool to create a new project and add the language, platforms, and packages your project requires. Set up your project by:
    
* [Creating a new custom project](/projects/custom)
* [Copying and editing (forking) an ActiveState project](/projects/forks)
* Use the [state init](/state/commands/init) and [state packages](/state/commands/packages) commands to create a new project and add the language, platforms (operating systems), and package requirements your code project needs. 

## Configure activestate.yaml

After you create an ActiveState project, complete the following steps to activate your project and add the configuration file to your code repository, so that the CI/CD has access to it.

1. Open your command prompt and navigate to the top level folder where you want to create your ActiveState Platform project.
2. Enter `state activate <owner/project_name>`. For example: `state activate acmetech/python-3-6-6`.
3. Copy the `activestate.yaml` configuration file to the root directory of your code repository.
4. Edit the `activestate.yaml` to add any scripts, variables, or secrets you want CI/CD to run or have access to. For more information on these options, see [Getting started](/state/start.htm).
5. Add `activestate.yaml` to the repository and check in your changes.

## Add an appveyor.yml file

You need to add an `appveyor.yml` file to the root of your code repository that includes all of the steps required to build, test, and deploy your code. The example provided demonstrates the State Tool-specific steps for installing the State Tool and running scripts that are defined in the `activestate.yaml` file for the project. The AppVeyor project is configured to build on Windows.

```text
version: 1.0.{build}
image: Visual Studio 2019
init:
- ps: ''
install:
- ps: >-
    (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadFile('https://platform.activestate.com/dl/cli/install.ps1', 'install.ps1')
    
    Invoke-Expression "install.ps1 -n"
build_script:
- cmd: state --version
test_script:
- cmd: >-
    state pull

    state run pip_install_pkgs_win

    state run build_installer_win

    dir
```

The scripts being executed in the `appveyor.yml` file are defined in the scripts section of the `activestate.yaml` file for the project:

```text
scripts:
  - name: clean
    description: Run the data cleaner script
    value: python3 cleaner.py
  - name: which-python
    description: Determine which python interpreter is being used
    language: python3
    value: |
      import sys
      print("Python script running with: ", sys.executable)
```

If you successfully configured your AppVeyor CI project, you will see a job start and complete successfully each time someone pushes new code changes to the repository.
